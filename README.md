Experiment 1: This experiment varies the number of samples and holds the number of dimensions constant. I replicated the experiment of Preetum Nakkiran in "More Data Can Hurt in Linear Regression: Sample-wise Double Descent." Here, I tried two settings for the number of dimensions/parameters: 1000 and 500. This did not make a difference, as the shape of the curve is a function of the ratio of <em>n</em> (the number of samples) to <em>p</em> (the number of parameters).
